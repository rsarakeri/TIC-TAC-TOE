for CASE 2: if we have the winner in the middle of the game we announce!!! & has continuous evaluation...
Note: Am using a british's divide rule... , i.e am going to make the theme into smaller chunks and run separately later intergration.  

if one willing to try by their own you can go ahead and try! and one who wants hint use the Solution Steps...

Solution Steps:

~ We need to print a board.
~ Take in player input.
~ Place their input on the board.
~ Check if the game is won,tied, lost ,or ongoing.(evaluation)
~ Repeat b to d until the game has been won or tied.
~ Ask if players want to play again.
